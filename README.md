## About
My purpose for this project was to challenge myself in learning more of Bootstrap 5's design templates but not only limited to BS5 Containers, Flex, and Carousels.

## Getting Started
1. In your index.html file: Get the HTMl5 boilerplate by using this [shortcut](https://backbencher.dev/html-boilerplate-code-visual-studio-code#:~:text=To%20try%20the%20shortcut%2C%20create,HTML5%20code%20to%20the%20file.).

2. Get Bootstrap5 on your project with BootstrapCDN to link to Boostrap's default stylesheet. Get the source code [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/). Place the link tag within the head tag and the script tag before the closing body tag.

3.  Get Custom CSS to override Bootstrap5 CSS. First, make a file for your custom css, you can call this file custom.css. Then place this link tag here directly under the link to the default stylesheet:
![Alt text](/BS_Override.png)

4. To get favicon library
